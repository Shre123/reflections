Lesson 1 of introduction to Git and GitHub has enlightened me about 
1.comparing different files
2. Get a good start on using Linux and Git Bash.
3. Intoduced me to Sublime.
4. Looks like this session is going to be fun!!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	1.Having the history of our work could easily give us an idea of how it progressed over the time.
	2. We can trace any changes done by anoyone over a period of time.
	3. We can restore to any of the older versions easily becaus none of our work is actually lost.

How do I want to use GIT?
	I want it to make my life simpler.
	My coding life more efficient and definitely more fun!!
