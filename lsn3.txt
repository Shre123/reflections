When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    May be when handling are many files of large size, I do not want to clutter and use the space of my local machine.
<<<<<<< HEAD

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Since the GitHub page is public, we might have commits that are not ready for public viewing yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Clone: Use it either to get a repository from GitHub to your local machine or from one place in local machine to another 
    directory.
    for cloning from GitHub to local:
                                                git clone "http url of the repository"
    Fork: Use this when you want to copy a repository from other user on GitHub to your own GitHub page.
    for forking:
                                                Click on the fork button on their page.
                                                
    Branch: Use this to create another branch similar to your master branch for tweaking, experimenting but still want to keep
    your master branch unaffected.
    To create a new branch:
                                                git branch "new branch name"
            
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	This is helpful when we go have to go without internet for a while, then we can make sure that we will be working on the file 
	with all the latest changes in them.
