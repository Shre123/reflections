What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	git init command is needed to initialise our  regular folder into something that is trackable by the git. So when I use the commit command it will save the versions of all the files in my folder turned repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	According to my understanding of the staging area, it is more like a edit mode of files, that tracks the changes in the file and saves them as a different version in the repository.
